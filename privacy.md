# Privacy Policy - MingleMap

Last updated: December 6, 2025

MingleMap ("the app") helps users connect and communicate with people nearby. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## Information We Collect

Depending on how you use the app, we may collect:

- **Account & Profile Information:** Information you provide, such as a display name, email address, and profile details.
- **Location Information:** Approximate and/or precise location (only if you grant permission) to enable location-based features like showing nearby users.
- **Camera & Photos:** If you choose to take or upload a photo (such as a profile photo), the app may request access to your camera and/or photo library. We only access the camera/photos when you initiate an action that requires it.
- **Messages & Communication Data:** Message content and related metadata required to deliver messaging features (for example: sender/recipient identifiers, timestamps, and delivery status).
- **Device & App Diagnostics (optional but common):** Basic diagnostic data (such as crash logs) to help improve performance and reliability.

## How We Use Your Information

We use information to:

- Provide core features (profiles, location-based discovery, and messaging).
- Maintain safety and prevent abuse (spam, harassment, or other violations).
- Improve and troubleshoot the app.

## Photo Storage (Cloud Storage Provider)

User-uploaded photos are stored using a third-party cloud storage provider to host and deliver images in the app. We do not sell your photos. Access to photos is limited to what is needed to provide the feature and to what you choose to share within the app.

## How We Share Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share information:

- With service providers (such as hosting, database, and cloud storage providers) only as needed to operate the app.
- If required by law, legal process, or to protect users and the integrity of the service.

## Data Retention

We retain information only as long as needed to operate the app and for legitimate business or legal purposes. You may request deletion (see Contact below).

## Your Choices

You can:

- Disable location permissions in your device settings (some features may not work).
- Deny camera/photo permissions (you may not be able to upload or take photos).
- Request account and data deletion.

## Children's Privacy

MingleMap is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Security

We use reasonable safeguards to protect your information, but no system can be guaranteed 100% secure.
